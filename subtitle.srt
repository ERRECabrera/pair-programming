I’m sorry you feel bad for hurting my feelings,

695
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:07,450
but don’t worry, you didn’t.

696
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,583
It wasn’t supposed to be personal. I was scouting you.

697
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:12,417
Scouting you for this exact moment.

698
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:13,884
— Humph.
— No, wait.

699
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:18,750
This is too important to get wrong.

700
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,683
“No one who matters pays attention,” right ?

701
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,250
Okay, stop selling me.

702
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,917
I don’t need you.

703
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,717
You think I don’t see it ?

704
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:27,283
This takes off, I write my own ticket,

705
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,617
but if it goes wrong, I’m a college dropout

706
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,083
repairing VCRs for $3.25 an hour,

707
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:35,117
so forgive me for weighing my options.

708
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,183
See ?

709
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:39,051
Now you’re thinking like a professional.

710
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,850
How much money would you give me ?

711
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:48,851
Junior engineer, no experience… 20 grand.

712
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,850
Double it.

713
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,883
My wife makes 15 at TI.

714
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,751
Well, then I feel sorry for her.

715
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,818
So ?

716
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:03,818

you ever tried to paddle to shore in.

751
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:57,517
I had some numbers run, looks like this PC business

752
00:43:57,518 --> 00:44:01,583
is gonna cost us upwards of a couple
million dollars just to get in the door.

753
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:03,517
So, in order to reach that perfect world

754
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:05,017
where we actually start selling things

755
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,450
rather than running from the bogeyman,

756
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:10,517
there will be some rules. One, no bullshit.

757
00:44:10,518 --> 00:44:13,217
— Sorry, what constitutes bull…
— Whatever I damn say it is.

758
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:18,150
Two, hours are now from when this
meeting is done until when you die.

759
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:22,917
And three, I know I can’t ﬁre any of you yet,

760
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:25,117
but that also means you can’t leave,

761
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,583
so if I need to stomp on one of y’all’s heads

762
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:28,483
to feel better about my morning shave,

763
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:32,817
whoa, you’re gonna have to ﬁnd a way to deal with that.

764
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:35,584
Do you understand ?

765
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:40,650
So, who’s my boss or whatever ?

766
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:42,050
Both: — Me.

You’re gonna be reciting them all day.

771
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:53,684
Joe, one more thing.

772
00:44:57,484 --> 00:44:59,883
According to IBM, you’ve been
on the side of a milk carton

773
00:44:59,884 --> 00:45:01,983
for about a year.

774
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:05,883
Yeah, I hired you. I didn’t check your references,

775
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:10,650
so whatever this is, son, I’m on the hook for it.

776
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:13,083
You understand ?

777
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:14,751
Yeah.

778
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:22,050
I’ve worked here for 22 years.

779
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:25,484
I helped build this company into what it is.

780
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:31,017
And you backed me into a corner in my own home ?

781
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:36,871
I’m never… I’m never gonna forget that.

782
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:40,584
Never.

783
00:45:41,784 --> 00:45:44,283
I’m gonna root through your closets, boy.

784
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:48,118
Oh, I’m gonna pull every loose thread.

785
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,517
— How are you ? Dale.
— Good to see ya.

786
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:13,917
Good to see you.

00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,550
